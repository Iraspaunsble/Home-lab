# Home Lab – Cybersecurity & IT Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on learning while studying IT fundamentals, networking, and cybersecurity.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build foundational technical skills
- Plan and document a personal home lab
- Practice explaining technical concepts clearly

This repository will be updated gradually throughout my coursework and independent study.
